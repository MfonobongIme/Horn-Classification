# Horn Classification System

## Introduction
This system is designed to classify different types of horn based on their sound recordings. It utilizes a dataset of horn sound recordings and corresponding labels to train a machine learning model. The trained model can then be used to classify new sound recordings of horns.

## Requirements
- Python 3.0
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- librosa
- numpy

## Usage
1. Run the `horn-classifier.ipynb` file to train the model using the provided dataset. The dataset should contain sound recordings of horns in the form of .wav files, and corresponding labels indicating the type of horn.
